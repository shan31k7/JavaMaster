            <i>Parallel Sorting Algorithms</i> explains how to use parallel algorithms to sort a sequence of items on a variety of parallel computers. The book reviews the sorting problem, the parallel models of computation, parallel algorithms, and the lower bounds on the parallel sorting problems. The text also presents twenty different algorithms, such as linear arrays, mesh-connected computers, cube-connected computers. Another example where algorithm can be applied is on the shared-memory <strong>SIMD (single instruction stream multiple data stream)</strong> computers in which the whole sequence to be sorted can fit in the respective primary memories of the computers (random access memory), or in a single shared memory.
